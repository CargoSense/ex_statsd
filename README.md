# NO LONGER MAINTAINED

It's been some time since we've had the time to maintain and improve `ex_statsd`; in the meantime, the [statix](https://hex.pm/packages/statix) package has emerged as the more modern (and certainly more well-maintained) alternative.

We recommend you transition to using [statix](https://hex.pm/packages/statix) and support its continued development [here on GitHub](https://github.com/lexmag/statix).

Regards,
Bruce and Ben
